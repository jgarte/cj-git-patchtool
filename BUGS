- check is broken right now; meaning, it will go actually applying patches until it will die  because of some errors in file (missing msg ..)

- Have seen this from git (is this *another* case than the one seen earlier?) when running 'app' ("Die Datei existiert bereits" is german for 'the file already exists'):

    Applying: create error.scm
    fatal: Unable to create '..../.git/index.lock': Die Datei existiert bereits.

    If no other git process is currently running, this probably means a
    git process crashed in this repository earlier. Make sure no other git
    process is running and remove the file manually to continue.
